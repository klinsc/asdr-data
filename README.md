# REAL-TIME PROTECTIVE RELAY DETECTION

## Experimenting on YOLO3
1. Colab https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_NGdtAdUg_JcjSuQOXvVyYOcu92OS9J1?usp=sharing
    - I tried to use colab to experiment on using of YOLO3, every tutorial step was fine until I met the OpenCV part,
    for the colab does not include "opencv for CPP" within the VM, and it is needed if I want to run the prediction real-time.
    Installing "opencv for CPP" slow as hell. Now I try switching to use my own local environment. Paid the colab pro for nothing already!

2. YOLO3 https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
    - The tutorial is very clearly documented. Except the prerequisite of "opencv for CPP",
    they told that I should use the package manager to install it for it is complicated to do it on my own. That is why I have to experinment on my local environment.
    
3. CUDA https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/
    - I downloaded the .exe file from the relative of URL above, we will see if it works or not.
